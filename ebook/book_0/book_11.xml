         At least one-third of the people
      we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer
      listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and
      create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their
      own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often
      labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the
      great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s
      sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.
        <br />
      </p>

        Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled
      with indelible stories of real people,
        <em>Quiet</em>
        shows how dramatically we undervalue
      introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the
      reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to
      Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an
      evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the
      Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its
      far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students
      who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of
      American schools. She questions the dominant values of
      American business culture, where forced collaboration can
      stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership
      potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on
      cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to
      reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and
      introverts.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful
      introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who
      recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking
      salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.
      Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how
      to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert
      relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when
      it makes sense to be a "pretend extrovert."

      <p>This extraordinary book has the power to permanently
      change how we see introverts and, equally important, how
      introverts see themselves.</p>
      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January
      2012</strong>
        : How many introverts do you know? The real
      answer will probably surprise you. In our culture, which
      emphasizes group work from elementary school through the
      business world, everything seems geared toward extroverts.
      Luckily, introverts everywhere have a new spokesperson: Susan
      Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert who’s taken it upon
      herself to better understand the place of introverts in
      culture and society. With
        <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That
      Can’t Stop Talking</em>
        , Cain explores introversion
      through psychological research old and new, personal
      experiences, and even brain chemistry, in an engaging and
      highly-readable fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain
      also seeks to find ways for introverts and extroverts to
      better understand one another--and for introverts to
      understand their own contradictions, such as the ability to
      act like extroverts in certain situations. Highly accessible
      and uplifting for any introvert--and any extrovert who knows
      an introvert (and over one-third of us are introverts)--
        <em>Quiet</em>
        has the potential to revolutionize the
      “extrovert ideal.”

      <p>
        <strong>Q: Why did you write the book?</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        For the same reason that Betty Friedan
      published
        <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>
        in 1963. Introverts are to
      extroverts what women were to men at that time--second-class
      citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Our
      schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed
      for extroverts, and many introverts believe that there is
      something wrong with them and that they should try to
      “pass” as extroverts. The bias against
      introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy,
      and, ultimately, happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What personal significance does the subject have
      for you?</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        When I was in my twenties, I started
      practicing corporate law on Wall Street. At first I thought I
      was taking on an enormous challenge, because in my mind, the
      successful lawyer was comfortable in the spotlight, whereas I
      was introverted and occasionally shy. But I soon realized
      that my nature had a lot of advantages: I was good at
      building loyal alliances, one-on-one, behind the scenes; I
      could close my door, concentrate, and get the work done well;
      and like many introverts, I tended to ask a lot of questions
      and listen intently to the answers, which is an invaluable
      tool in negotiation. I started to realize that there’s
      a lot more going on here than the cultural stereotype of the
      introvert-as-unfortunate would have you believe. I had to
      know more, so I spent the past five years researching the
      powers of introversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Was there ever a time when American society valued
      introverts more highly?</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        In the nation’s earlier years it
      was easier for introverts to earn respect. America once
      embodied what the cultural historian Warren Susman called a
      “Culture of Character,” which valued inner
      strength, integrity, and the good deeds you performed when no
      one was looking. You could cut an impressive figure by being
      quiet, reserved, and dignified. Abraham Lincoln was revered
      as a man who did not “offend by superiority,” as
      Emerson put it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: You discuss how we can better embrace introverts
      in the workplace. Can you explain?</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        Introverts thrive in environments that
      are not overstimulating—surroundings in which they can
      think (deeply) before they speak. This has many implications.
      Here are two to consider: (1) Introverts perform best in
      quiet, private workspaces—but unfortunately we’re
      trending in precisely the opposite direction, toward
      open-plan offices. (2) If you want to get the best of all
      your employees’ brains, don’t simply throw them
      into a meeting and assume you’re hearing
      everyone’s ideas. You’re not; you’re
      hearing from the most vocally assertive people. Ask people to
      put their ideas in writing before the meeting, and make sure
      you give everyone time to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Q:
          <em>Quiet</em>
          offers some terrific insights for the parents
      of introverted children. What environment do introverted kids
      need in order to thrive, whether it’s at home or at
      school?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        The best thing parents and teachers can
      do for introverted kids is to treasure them for who they are,
      and encourage their passions. This means: (1) Giving them the
      space they need. If they need to recharge alone in their room
      after school instead of plunging into extracurricular
      activities, that’s okay. (2) Letting them master new
      skills at their own pace. If they’re not learning to
      swim in group settings, for example, teach them privately.
      (3) Not calling them “shy”--they’ll believe
      the label and experience their nervousness as a fixed trait
      rather than an emotion they can learn to control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: What are the advantages to being an
      introvert?</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>A:</strong>
        There are too many to list in this short
      space, but here are two seemingly contradictory qualities
      that benefit introverts: introverts like to be alone--and
      introverts enjoy being cooperative. Studies suggest that many
      of the most creative people are introverts, and this is
      partly because of their capacity for quiet. Introverts are
      careful, reflective thinkers who can tolerate the solitude
      that idea-generation requires. On the other hand,
        <em>implementing</em>
        good ideas requires cooperation, and
      introverts are more likely to prefer cooperative
      environments, while extroverts favor competitive ones.

        <li>
          <p>Which parts of QUIET resonated most strongly with you?

          why?</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          challenging about working with introverts?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>QUIET explains how Western society evolved from a
          Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality. Are
          there enclaves in our society where a Culture of
          Character still holds sway? What would a
          twenty-first-century Culture of Character look like?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>QUIET talks about the New Groupthink, the value system
          holding that creativity and productivity emerge from
          group work rather than individual thought. Have you
          experienced this in your own workplace?</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          you’re not temperamentally compatible?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you’re in a relationship, how does your
          temperament compare to that of your partner? How do you
          handle areas in which you’re not compatible?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do you enjoy social media such as Facebook and
          Twitter, and do you think this has something to do with
          your temperament?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>QUIET talks about “restorative niches,”
          the places introverts go or the things they do to
          recharge their batteries. What are your favorite
          restorative niches?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Susan Cain calls for a Quiet Revolution. Would you
          like to see this kind of a movement take place, and if
          so, what is the number-one change you’d like to see
          happen?</p>
