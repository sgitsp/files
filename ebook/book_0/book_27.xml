         The Man Who Inspired the World's
      Fastest-Growing Religion
        <em>Muhammad</em>
        presents a fascinating portrait of the
      founder of a religion that continues to change the course of
      world history. Muhammad's story is more relevant than ever
      because it offers crucial insight into the true origins of an
      increasingly radicalized Islam. Countering those who dismiss
      Islam as fanatical and violent, Armstrong offers a clear,
      accessible, and balanced portrait of the central figure of
      one of the world's great religions.**

      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>Muhammad was born in 570 CE, and over the following sixty
      years built a thriving spiritual community, laying the
      foundations of a religion that changed the course of world
      history. There is more historical data on his life than on
      that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet his
      story is little known. Karen Armstrong's immaculately
      researched new biography of Muhammad will enable readers to
      understand the true origins and spirituality of a faith that
      is all too often misrepresented as cruel, intolerant, and
      inherently violent. An acclaimed authority on religious and
      spiritual issues, Armstrong offers a balanced, in-depth
      portrait, revealing the man at the heart of Islam by
      dismantling centuries of misconceptions. Armstrong
      demonstrates that Muhammad's life—a pivot point in
      history—has genuine relevance to the global crises we
      face today. Discover More Eminent Lives</p>

      <h3>From Booklist</h3>
      <p>
        Armstrong's second biography of Islam's prophet is lucid
      and stylish, never condescending. It puts the best face
      possible on its subject. The Muhammad it projects gave his
      followers "a mission: to create a just and decent society, in
      which all members were treated with respect." Moreover,
      Armstrong's Muhammad behaved justly and decently while he
      lived, though perhaps a bit according to the stringent
      standards of Arab culture at the time. He taught tolerance
      toward Jews and Christians. Never mind--Armstrong
      doesn't--about denials of civil equality to non-Muslims and
      fulminations about them as "infidels." The Jewish clan whose
      men were exterminated after a particular battle? It wasn't
      that they were Jews but that they were traitors, and it
      wasn't Muhammad who decided they should be executed. The fact
      that, after declaring that Muslim men could have no more than
      four wives, Muhammad himself exceeded the limit? Hey, a
      leader has to make alliances with other groups. A nicely
      written book, but don't let it be the only biography of
      Muhammad you read.
