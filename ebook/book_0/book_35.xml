          The #1
          <em>New York Times</em>
           bestselling guide to
      decluttering your home and the inspiration for the hit
      Netflix show
          <em>Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</em>
          .
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers
      still accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a
      tangled mess of noodles?</p>
      <p>Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to
      a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify
      and organize your home once, you’ll never have to do it
      again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or
      little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at
      your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its
      revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting
      results. In fact, none of Kondo’s clients have lapsed
      (and she still has a three-month waiting list). </p>
      <p>With detailed guidance for determining which items in your
      house “spark joy” (and which don’t), this
      international bestseller featuring Tokyo’s newest
      lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and
      enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home—and the calm,
      motivated mindset it can inspire.**</p>
