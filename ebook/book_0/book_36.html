        <b>Sigit Purwadi's Library</b>
      </a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;For the first time in 65 years, a modern,
      easy to understand, truly complete and uncensored edition of
      Mein Kampf has been released which reveals more than any past
      translation. This hardcover book is also the first
      translation available in an English language audio
      format.</p>
      
<p>Older translations altered passages, omitted passages,
      mistranslated Hitler's words, made some parts more
      sensational while concealing the true meaning in other parts
      of the book. If you have read one of these older translations
      of Mein Kampf, then you have not read the REAL Mein Kampf
      which is found only in the Ford Translation.</p>
      
<p>Mein Kampf is often portrayed as nothing more than an
      Anti-Semitic work, however only 6% of it even talks about the
      Jews. The rest contains Hitler's ideas and beliefs for a
      greater nation plus his plan on how to accomplish that goal.
      He outlines his plans for not only world conquest, but the
      conquest of the universe. The majority of the work involves
      Hitler's discussion of the German people's difficult times
      after the First World War, his political theories and his
      organization of the Nazi Party, as well as many attacks
      against his enemies which makes it a very interesting and
      moving story.</p>
      
<p>Mein Kampf offers an interesting interpretation of
      politics, people, and foreign policy matters. To characterize
      it as simply a racist work is to oversimplify its message.
      Germany did not follow Hitler because he was a racist, they
      followed him because he promised a great future, and Mein
      Kampf is where he promised that great future.
      <br>This edition is the only accurate and complete English
      translation of Mein Kampf ever made.</p>
      
<p>This Ford Translation offers:</p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>The most accurate translation ever produced.</li>
        
<li>Phrases that are translated with precision and with no
        translator's bias.</li>
        
<li>Uncommon words are replaced with more common and more
        meaningful terms.</li>
        
<li>Any references to unfamiliar people, or places are
        explained in the text.</li>
        
<li>This version is complete with all original passages and
        references restored, including passages omitted from other
        popular versions.</li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>This translation has corrected over 1000 errors which were
      present in past translations.</p>
      
<p>No English reader has been able to appreciate these
      subtleties in any previous English translation, not until the
      Ford Translation.</p>
      
<p>Includes Photos and Illustrations of events and people in
      Mein Kampf Volume I and II
      <br>Click the order button to receive the book so many
      people wish to disparage and see why they will do anything to
      have the printing of this book outlawed. They have already
      tried...</p>
      
<p>This is the only edition that was so thoroughly researched
      and verified that it required a separate book(Mein Kampf: A
      Translation Controversy) to document the changes and
      corrections made which prove the dynamic style of the Ford
      translation is superior to all past mechanical
      translations.</p>
      
<p>Read the hardback version, then decide for yourself if he
      was a mad-man or a genius.**</p>
      
<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      
<p>The angry ranting of an obscure, small-party politician,
      the first volume of 
      <em>Mein Kampf</em> was virtually ignored when it was
      originally published in 1925. Likewise the second volume,
      which appeared in 1926. The book details Hitler's childhood,
      the "betrayal" of Germany in World War I, the desire for
      revenge against France, the need for lebensraum for the
      German people, and the means by which the National Socialist
      party can gain power. It also includes Hitler's racist agenda
      and his glorification of the "Aryan" race. The few outside
      the Nazi party who read it dismissed it as nonsense, not
      believing that anyone could--or would--carry out its radical,
      terrorist programs. As Hitler and the Nazis gained power,
      first party members and then the general public were
      pressured to buy the book. By the time Hitler became
      chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, the book stood atop
      the German bestseller lists. Had the book been taken
      seriously when it was first published, perhaps the 20th
      century would have been very different. Beyond the anger,
      hatred, bigotry, and self-aggrandizing, 
      <em>Mein Kampf</em> is saddled with tortured prose,
      meandering narrative, and tangled metaphors (one person was
      described as "a thorn in the eyes of venal officials"). That
      said, it is an incredibly important book. It is foolish to
      think that the Holocaust could not happen again, especially
      if World War II and its horrors are forgotten. As an
      Amazon.com reader has pointed out, "If you want to learn
      about why the Holocaust happened, you can't avoid reading the
      words of the man who was most responsible for it happening." 
      <em>Mein Kampf</em> , therefore, must be read as a reminder
      that evil can all too easily grow. --

<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      
<p>A Message from the Anti-Defamation League: 
      <em>Mein Kampf</em> was Hitler's blueprint for what later
      became his war for world domination and for the extermination
      of the Jews and others. Written eight years before he assumed
      power in Germany, the book lays it all out: his megalomania,
      his conspiratorial obsession with Jews and his lust for
      power. For all who claimed they didn't know, all they had to
      do was read 
      <em>Mein Kampf</em> to know of Hitler's intentions.&nbsp;</p>
