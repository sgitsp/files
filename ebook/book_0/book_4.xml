      <p>The #1 bestseller, with over 600 five star reviews on
      Amazon!</p>
      <p>TURNED is book #1 in the #1 Bestselling series THE VAMPIRE
      JOURNALS, which includes eleven books (and counting).</p>
      <p>In TURNED (Book #1 of the Vampire Journals), 18 year old
      Caitlin Paine finds herself uprooted from her nice suburb and
      forced to attend a dangerous New York City high school when
      her Mom moves again. The one ray of light in her new
      surroundings is Jonah, a new classmate who takes an instant
      liking to her.</p>
      <p>But before their romance can blossom, Caitlin suddenly
      finds herself changing. She is overcome by a superhuman
      strength, a sensitivity to light, a desire to feed--by
      feelings she does not understand. She seeks answers to
      what’s happening to her, and her cravings lead her to
      the wrong place at the wrong time. Her eyes are opened to a
      hidden world, right beneath her feet, thriving underground in
      New York City. She finds herself caught between two dangerous
      covens, right in the middle of a vampire war.</p>
      <p>It is at this moment that Caitlin meets Caleb, a
      mysterious and powerful vampire who rescues her from the dark
      forces. He needs her to help lead him to the legendary lost
      artifact. And she needs him for answers, and for protection.
      Together, they will need to answer one crucial question: who
      was her real father?</p>
      <p>But Caitlin finds herself caught between two men as
      something else arises between them: a forbidden love. A love
      between the races that will risk both of their lives, and
      will force them to decide whether to risk it all for each
      other…</p>

        "TURNED is an ideal story for young readers. Morgan Rice
      did a good job spinning an interesting twist on what could
      have been a typical vampire tale. Refreshing and unique,
      TURNED has the classic elements found in many Young Adult
      paranormal stories. Book #1 of the Vampire Journals Series
      focuses around one girl…one extraordinary
      girl!...TURNED is easy to read but extremely
      fast-paced....Recommended for anyone who likes to read soft
      paranormal romances. Rated PG."
        <br />
        --The Romance Reviews
      </p>
      <p>
        “TURNED grabbed my attention from the beginning and
      did not let go….This story is an amazing adventure that
      is fast paced and action packed from the very beginning.
      There is not a dull moment to be found. Morgan Rice did an
      awesome job bringing the reader into the story. She also made
      it easy to root for Caitlin and want desperately to her
      succeed in finding her truth….I will be looking forward
      to the second book in the series.”
        <br />
        --Paranormal Romance Guild
      </p>
      <p>
        “TURNED is a likable, easy, dark read that you can
      read in between other books, as it is
      short….You’re sure to be entertained!“
