<em>"There could only be a few winners, and a lot of

<p>In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of
      a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the
      seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world,
      but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is
      married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an
      offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing
      through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her
      home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a
      dramatic saga that will echo down through the
      generations.</p>
      
<p>Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of
      love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street
      markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the
      pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex
      and passionate characters--strong, stubborn women, devoted
      sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis--survive and
      thrive against the indifferent arc of history.</p>

<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      
<p>
      
<strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2017:</strong>
      Beginning in 1910 during the time of Japanese colonialization
      and ending many decades later in 1989, 
      <em>Pachinko</em> is the epic saga of a Korean family told
      over four generations. The family&rsquo;s story starts with
      Hoonie, a young Korean man born with physical deformities,
      but whose destiny comes from his inner strength and kindness.
      Hoonie&rsquo;s daughter, rather than bring shame on her
      family, leaves their homeland for Japan, where her children
      and grandchildren will be born and raised; yet prejudice
      against their Korean heritage will prevent them from ever
      feeling at home. In 
      <em>Pachinko</em> , Min Jin Lee says much about success and
      suffering, prejudice and tradition, but the novel never bogs
      down and only becomes richer, like a sauce left simmering
      hour after hour. Lee&rsquo;s exceptional story of one family
      is the story of many of the world&rsquo;s people. They ask
      only for the chance to belong somewhere&mdash;and to be
      judged by their hearts and actions rather than by ideas of
      blood traits and bad seeds.
