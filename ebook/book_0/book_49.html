        <b>Sigit Purwadi's Library</b>
      </a> - 
      <em>
      <em>The #1</em> New York Times</em> Bestseller</p>
      
<p>A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the
      pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the
      star of 
      <em>Master of None</em> and one of this generation&rsquo;s
      sharpest comedic voices**</p>
      
<p>At some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to
      find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of
      relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom
      we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but
      it&rsquo;s wildly different from what people did even just
      decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options
      than at any point in human history. With technology, our
      abilities to connect with and sort through these options are
      staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?</p>
      
<p>Some of our problems are unique to our time. &ldquo;Why
      did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Should I go out with this girl even though she listed
      Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named
      Nathan. Who&rsquo;s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of
      his penis? Should I check just to be sure?&rdquo;</p>
      
<p>But the transformation of our romantic lives can&rsquo;t
      be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time,
      the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A
      few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived
      in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after
      deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get
      married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were
      twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend
      years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a
      soul mate.</p>
      
<p>For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight
      at modern romance, but for 
      <em>Modern Romance</em> , the book, he decided he needed to
      take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU
      sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research
      project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups
      conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita.
      They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their
      own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of
      messages. They enlisted the world&rsquo;s leading social
      scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen
      Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and
      Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor
      book we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>
      
<p>In 
      <em>Modern Romance</em> , Ansari combines his irreverent
      humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an
      unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.**</p>
      
<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      
<p>
      
<strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Aziz
      Ansari&rsquo;s first book 
      <em>Modern Love</em> is thoughtful, deep, and outright
      hilarious: it&rsquo;s definitely not your run-of-the-mill
      actor/comedian book offering, and it works. He takes a hot
      topic that has been a part of his recent
      stand-up&mdash;navigating this minefield called
      dating&mdash;and brings it to a whole new level. The book
      includes extensive research, data, and insight from leading
      experts in the field (he co-wrote it with a social
      scientist)&mdash;all sprinkled with Ansari&rsquo;s signature,
      and spot-on, voice of a generation. Would I have read 
      <em>Modern Love</em> by [insert name of expert here]? No way.
      If I am going to take a long hard look at this subject, I
      want Ansari along for the ride. Aziz lets you know the
      struggle is real, and we&rsquo;re all going through it, so be
      nice.

<h3>Review</h3>
      
<p>
      
<strong>
        <em>New York Times</em>
      </strong> :
      <br>"A sprightly, easygoing hybrid of fact, observation,
      advice and comedy."
      <br> 
      
<strong>
      <em>
      
<br>USA Today
      <strong>
      <em>:
      <br> "With topics like online dating apps to serious social
      science research, the book is sure to have you laughing if
      not taking a few notes.&rdquo;
      <br>
      
<br>
</em> The Guardian</strong></em> :
      <br> &ldquo;Entertaining and illuminating.&rdquo;
      <br>
      
<br>
</strong> 
      <em>Rolling Stone
      <strong>
      <em>:
      <br> &ldquo;A hilarious, often unsettling account of what
      young singles go through as they search for love in the
      digital age.&rdquo;
      <br>
      
<br> *</em> *Boston Globe</strong></em> :
      <br>&ldquo;A funny and scholarly examination of the 24-hour
      romance cycle.&rdquo;
      <br>
      
<br> 
      
<strong>*Paste Magazine</strong>* :
      <br>&ldquo;The book is an obsessive exploration of what
      makes hearts flutter and break across the globe, but most
      importantly, it dissects those ideas through the lens of a
      right-and-left swiping society. And as a result,
      Ansari&rsquo;s final product doesn&rsquo;t only feel
      complete&mdash;it&rsquo;s hilariously executed, even without
      his unmistakable high-register voice belting the punchlines.
      At 250 pages, Modern Romance is a lean, pithy read
      that&rsquo;s perfect to reach the tech-obsessed generation it
      explores.&rdquo;</p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>
        
<strong>Refinery 29</strong>* :
        <br>&ldquo;An engaging look at the often head-scratching,
        frequently infuriating mating behaviors that shape our love
        lives.&rdquo;</li>
      
</ul>
      
<p>
      
<strong>VOX:</strong>
      
<br>&ldquo;With his first foray into the literary sphere,
      Ansari handedly accomplishes what he set out to do. 
      <em>Modern Romance</em> provides insight into what people do
      to find love. He infuses their stories with his sass and
      parallels their shame with much of his own. On top of that,
      Ansari&rsquo;s advice is easy to follow and backed with
      science and research. 
      <em>Modern Romance</em> is the pinnacle of romantic guides
      &mdash; at least until a new dating app makes it
      obsolete.&rdquo;</p>
      
<p>
      
<strong>*The A.V. Club :</strong> 
      <em>
      
<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to think of another celebrity
      book that also feels like breaking news&hellip; Aside from the
      jokes, the science of</em> Modern Romance* holds water, and
      is absolutely fascinating.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>
        <em>The Source</em>
      </strong> :
      <br>&ldquo;This book is essentially an Aziz Ansari standup
      routine in print form. His unique voice is present throughout
      the book. One reason that people love Aziz is his outlook on
      life. He has a funny way of refocusing seemingly ordinary
      things and zeroing in on very small details that most would
      not notice. He brings all of that and more to the table with
      this book. This book is informative, presents a lot of
      thought provoking topics and discusses them thoroughly.
      Paired with Aziz&rsquo;s distinct voice, this book is even
      more endearing.&rdquo;

</em> The Atlantic</strong></em> :
      <br> &ldquo;Modern Romance reads like a CliffsNotes to
      relationshipping as it is currently experienced by (mostly
      middle-class, Ansari admits, and mostly straight) Americans.
      It&rsquo;s the familiar stuff of research and sitcomedy,
      distilled into a funny, and highly readable, summary.&rdquo;

</strong> 
      <em>Bustle
      <strong>
      <em>:
      <br> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to find a traditional
      humor book. And that&rsquo;s a good thing. Modern Romance is
      something a bit more unique: a comprehensive, in-depth
      sociological investigation into the &lsquo;many challenges of
      looking for love in the digital age.&rsquo; Modern Romance
      gives an impressive overview of how the dating game has
      changed with the advent of cell phones and the Internet. But
      there&rsquo;s also some practical advice peppered in there by
      Ansari himself.&rdquo;

<br> O, The Oprah Magazine :</strong></em>
      
<br>&ldquo;Even comedy phenoms get dumped. But when it was
      this Parks and Recreation star&rsquo;s turn, he channeled the
      rejection into an extensive (and riotous) investigation of
      the current state of dating, going as far as recruiting an
      NYU sociologist to be his collaborator/wingman.&rdquo;</p>

<strong>*Bookforum</strong> 
      <em>:

<p>Kirkus Reviews
      <strong>
      <em>:
      <br>&ldquo;The ever hip and funny comedian and Parks and
      Recreation star embarks on a surprisingly insightful
      exploration of the complex realities of dating today&hellip;.
      Ansari&rsquo;s eminently readable book is successful, in
      part, because it not only lays out the history, evolution,
      and pitfalls of dating, it also offers sound advice on how to
      actually win today&rsquo;s constantly shifting game of love.
      Often hilarious, consistently informative, and unusually
      helpful.&rdquo;</em> *</strong>

<p>Natasha Gilmore, *Publishers Weekly: 
      <strong>
      <em>*</em>
      
<br>&ldquo;Ansari, a comedian and TV actor, has co-written
      a book with a legitimate sociologist about what it means to
      date in the modern era. When technology and instant
      gratification are changing the landscape of human
      interactions, dating is weirder than ever, and I'm looking
      forward to Ansari's sense of humor and cultural criticism on
      the topic, which he's started to address in his
      stand-up.&rdquo;</strong>
</p>
      
<p>Steven Levitt, coauthor of the #1 
      <em>New York Times</em> bestselling 
      <em>Freakonomics</em>** :
      <br>&ldquo;Always-hilarious Aziz Ansari proves you can be
      smart and funny at the same time. Not only did I laugh my ass
      off, I really learned stuff. Where was this book when I was
      22 years old? &rdquo;</p>

<strong>Jonathan Safran Foer, author of *Eating
      Animals</strong> 
      <em>:</em> *
      <br>&ldquo;Laughing is my second least-favorite thing in
      the world after thinking. This book was torture. Not a page
      passed without an unwanted eruption of giggles or insight.
      Aziz is funny as hell, and smart as shit.&rdquo;</p>

      <br>&ldquo;It's the voices that will have you reading this
      remarkable book in one sitting! The voices of old people who
      married someone who lived in their apartment building or the
      building next door and the voices of the young people who
      check out hundreds of romantic possibilities a night, with so
      much choice that choice becomes impossible. And then there is
      the voice of Ansari himself, funny, of course, but also
      deeply compassionate. This book defines serious
      fun.&rdquo;</p>

<br>&ldquo; 
      <em>Modern Romance</em> is just like Aziz Ansari

<br>&ldquo;Ansari and Klinenberg elegantly capture the
      entirely new ways that singles communicate, court, and find
