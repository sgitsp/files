         Salt has been an essential dining
      element since the invention of the kitchen table. But today,
      specialty salts come in a vast variety of forms and flavors.
      Smokey salts, salts infused with clay or charcoal, herby and
      spicy salts, salt with extra umami or a hint of sugar are
      being added to many recipes, to layer more flavor, and not
      simply to enhance the flavors already there. It’s a
      feast for the tongue, and colorful salts also add visual
      interest to dishes, and the varying textures add crunch.But
      how do you decide which to buy—and how do you get the
      most out of them once you’ve brought them back home to
      your kitchen?
        <em>Salt</em>
        will show you how to choose and how use them in
      simple, delicious recipes for every meal of the day. You will
      learn how to cook, cure, and bake with them. Plus,
      you’ll find a market guide that describes the different
      types of specialty and infused salts, discover ways to cook
      with salt blocks, and even how to organize your own salt
      tasting at home. More than 100 mouthwatering
      recipes—plus nearly 50 varieties of infused
      salts—with beautiful, full-color photography will help
      you transform this classic, humble ingredient into a star
      seasoning.**
