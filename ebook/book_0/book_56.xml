      beyond – from overcoming death to creating artificial

      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2017:</strong>
        Those
      who read and loved Yuval Noah Harari’s
        <em>Sapiens</em>
        have been eagerly anticipating his new book
        <em>Homo Deus</em>
        . While
        <em>Sapiens</em>
        looked back at our evolutionary development,
      this new book examines where we might be headed (
        <em>Homo Deus</em>
        is subtitled “A Brief History of
      Tomorrow”). Predicting the future isn’t as easy
      as deconstructing the past, and Harari openly admits the
      challenge—but even if he’s completely wrong in
      his predictions, and most of us doubt he is,
        <em>Homo Deus</em>
        is the kind of provocative,
      food-for-thought read that drew so many of us to his work in
      the first place. According to Harari, our future could be
      very different from our present—dark, technocratic, and
      automated—but reading about our possible fates,
      presented in Harari’s clear-eyed and illuminating
      style, sure is fascinating.

        "Here is a simple reason why
        <em>Sapiens</em>
        has
        <strong>risen explosively to the ranks of an international
      bestseller</strong>
        . It tackles the biggest questions of
      history and of the modern world, and it is written in
      unforgettably vivid language." -- Jared Diamond, Pulitzer
      Prize-winning author of
        <em>

        <em>“</em>
        Homo Deus
        <em>will shock you. It will entertain you. Above all, it will
      make you think in ways you had not thought

        “Israeli Professor Harari is one of today’s
      most exciting and provocative thinkers. His innovative new
      book blends science, history and philosophy to explore the
      future of humanity in the face of artificial intelligence and
      examine whether our species will be rendered completely
      redundant.” –

          Cambridge Network
          <br />
        </em>
        <br />
        “Spellbinding. . . . This is a very intelligent
      book, full of sharp insights and mordant wit. . . . Its real
      power comes from the sense of a distinctive consciousness
      behind it. It is a quirky and cool book, with a sliver of ice
      at its heart. . .  It is hard to imagine anyone could
      read this book without getting an occasional, vertiginous
      thrill. –
        <em>The Guardian</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>“</strong>
        It’s a chilling prospect, but
      the AI we’ve created could transform human nature,
      argues this spellbinding new book by the author of 
        <em>Sapiens</em>
        .” –
        <em>The Guardian</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Nominally a historian, Harari is in fact an
      intellectual magpie who has plucked theories and data from
      many disciplines — including philosophy, theology,
      computer science and biology — to produce a brilliantly
      original, thought-provoking and important study of where
      mankind is heading.” –
        <em>Evening Standard</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        “Harari’s work is . . . an unsettling
      meditation on the future. He’s opened a portal for us
      to contemplate on what kind of relationships we are forming
      with our data-crunching machines and whether
      ‘right’ must be determined by empirical evidence
      or good old ‘gut instinct.’” –
        <em>
          The Hindu
          <br />
        </em>
        <br />
        “[Harari’s] propositions are
      well-developed, drawing upon a combination of science,
      philosophy and history. While the book offers a rather
      pessimistic and even nihilistic view of man’s future,
      it is written with wit and style and makes compelling
      reading.” –
