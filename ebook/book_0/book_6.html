      <a href="https://repo.purwadi.web.id/ebook/">Sigit Purwadi's
      Library</a>&nbsp;-</b>&nbsp;In&nbsp; 
      <em>Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus,</em> now expanded with
      bonus content, Nabeel Qureshi describes his dramatic journey
      from Islam to&nbsp;Christianity, complete with friendships,
      investigations, and supernatural&nbsp;dreams along the
      way.Providing an intimate&nbsp;window into a loving Muslim
      home, Qureshi shares how he developed a passion
      for&nbsp;Islam&nbsp;before&nbsp;discovering, almost against
      his will,&nbsp;evidence that Jesus rose from the dead and
      claimed to be God. Unable to deny the arguments&nbsp;but not
      wanting&nbsp;to deny his family, Qureshi struggled with an
      inner turmoil that will challenge Christians, Muslims, and
      all those who are interested in the world&rsquo;s greatest
      religions.Engaging and&nbsp;thought-provoking,&nbsp; 
      <em>Seeking Allah, Finding&nbsp;Jesus</em> &nbsp;tells a
      powerful story of the clash between Islam
      and&nbsp;Christianity in&nbsp;one man&rsquo;s heart?and of
      the peace he eventually&nbsp;found in&nbsp;Jesus. 
      <em>"I have seldom seen such genuine intellect combined with
      passion to match ... truly a 'must-read' book."&mdash;</em>

<h3>Review</h3>
      
<p>Dr. Qureshi&rsquo;s book Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus
      offers the fascinating story of the conversion of a sincere
      young Ahmadiyya man who tried his best to seek Allah and
      eventually fell in love with Christ. I trust that this book
      can be a powerful encouragement for all Christians to pray
      for many Muslims to find Jesus Christ. -- Mark Gabriel, ,
      Author and former lecturer, University of Cairo</p>
      
<p>Fresh, striking, highly illuminating, and sometimes
      heartbreaking, Qureshi&rsquo;s story is worth a thousand
      textbooks. It should be read by Muslims and all who care
      deeply about our Muslim friends and fellow-citizens. -- Dr.
      Os Guinness, , Author and social critic</p>
      
<p>Nabeel Qureshi&rsquo;s story is among the most unique two
      or three testimonies that I have ever heard. Add to this the
      fact that I knew Nabeel quite well while he was still a
      Muslim, having visited with and spoken to him several times
      during his search for the one true God. His quest brought
      together several exceptional features: a very bright mind,
      extraordinary sincerity, original research, and a willingness
      to follow the evidence trail wherever it took him. His search
      led to the cross and to Jesus Christ, who was resurrected
      from the dead. -- Gary R. Habermas, , Distinguished Research
      Professor, Liberty University</p>
      
<p>Nabeel describes the yearning in the hearts of millions of
      Muslims around the world. This book is a must-read for all
      seeking to share the hope of Christ with Muslims. -- Fouad
      Masri, , President and CEO, Crescent Project</p>
      
<p>This book gives westerners a glimpse of the richness of
      family and love in a devout Muslim home; it is an enviable
      picture of respect, devotion, and society. But Christians and
      Muslims alike are told stories about their religions when
      they are young, while few have ever personally researched the
      writings of their founding fathers to assess the validity
      that undergirds their respective faiths. In his personal
      quest to know the truth, Nabeel Qureshi paves the way for an
      analytical study of the faiths, dissecting the Christian and
      Islamic arguments, specifically citing numerous Islamic
      hadith and early Christian texts, so that the reader can see
      a logical progression to the analyses. But it is also a
      deeply personal heart-wrenching and tear-evoking saga of the
      life of a young Muslim growing up in the West, a gripping
      biography that is impossible to put down. In the end, many
      people of faith will agree: Nabeel Qureshi needs our prayers.
      God bless this young man for his boldness, and we pray for
      his protection. -- James M. Tour, , Professor of Chemistry,
      Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Rice University</p>
      
<p>For anyone seeking understanding of their Muslim neighbors
      or colleagues, this is a book to read. We go on a journey
      from the inside out. We are introduced to the depth of
      spirituality, the love and honor of family, and the way a
      person &ldquo;sees&rdquo; and &ldquo;feels&rdquo; in a devout
      Muslim home. This is profound book that skillfully shows the
      core differences between the gospel and Islamic claims. I
      highly recommend it. -- Dr. Stuart McAllister, , Regional
      Director The Americas, Ravi Zacharias International
      Ministries</p>
      
<p>Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus is an urgently needed book
      with a gripping story. It reaches both East and West,
      teaching Christians about Islam from an insider&rsquo;s
      perspective and helping Muslims understand the love and truth
      of Jesus. Nabeel Qureshi masterfully argues for the Gospel
      while painting a beautiful portrait of Muslim families and
      heritage, avoiding the fear-mongering and finger-pointing
      that are all too pervasive in today&rsquo;s sensationalist
      world. I unreservedly recommend this book to all. ---It will
      feed your heart and mind, while keeping your fingers turning
      the page! -- Josh McDowell, , Author and Speaker</p>
      
<p>Nabeel Qureshi is a medical doctor by training with two
      master&rsquo;s degrees in biblical studies and further
      academic work on the horizon. He first began to study the
      Bible in order to challenge it and, incredibly, came to know
      Jesus as a result. In my many travels, I have seldom seen
      such genuine intellect combined matched with passion. I am
      thrilled to see his unique and gripping story in print and
      know that you will be encouraged and profoundly challenged by
      it as well. This is truly a &ldquo;must-read book&rdquo; for
      our times, as diverse worldviews each must face the test of
      truth. -- Ravi Zacharias, , Author and Speaker</p>
