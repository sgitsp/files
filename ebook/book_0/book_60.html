<b>
      <a href="https://repo.purwadi.web.id/ebook/">Sigit Purwadi's
      Library</a>&nbsp;-</b>&nbsp;No religion in the modern world
      is as feared and misunderstood as Islam. It haunts the
      popular Western imagination as an extreme faith that promotes
      authoritarian government, female oppression, civil war, and
      terrorism. Karen Armstrong's short history offers a vital
      corrective to this narrow view. The distillation of years of
      thinking and writing about Islam, it demonstrates that the
      world's fastest-growing faith is a much richer and more
      complex phenomenon than its modern fundamentalist strain
      might suggest.</p>
      
<p>
      
<em>Islam: A Short History</em> begins with the flight of
      Muhammad and his family from Medina in the seventh century
      and the subsequent founding of the first mosques. It recounts
      the origins of the split between Shii and Sunni Muslims, and
      the emergence of Sufi mysticism; the spread of Islam
      throughout North Africa, the Levant, and Asia; the shattering
      effect on the Muslim world of the Crusades; the flowering of
      imperial Islam in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries into
      the world's greatest and most sophisticated power; and the
      origins and impact of revolutionary Islam. It concludes with
      an assessment of Islam today and its challenges.</p>
      
<p>With this brilliant book, Karen Armstrong issues a
      forceful challenge to those who hold the view that the West
      and Islam are civilizations set on a collision course. It is
      also a model of authority, elegance, and economy.**</p>
      
<h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      
<p>The picture of Islam as a violent, backward, and insular
      tradition should be laid to rest, says Karen Armstrong,
      bestselling author of 
      <em>Muhammad</em> and 
      <em>A History of God</em>. Delving deep into Islamic history,
      Armstrong sketches the arc of a story that begins with the
      stirring of revelation in an Arab businessman named Muhammad.
      His concern with the poor who were being left behind in the
      blush of his society's new prosperity sets the tone for the
      tale of a culture that values community as a manifestation of
      God. Muhammad's ideas catch fire, quickly blossoming into a
      political empire. As the empire expands and the once
      fractured Arabs subdue and overtake the vast Persian domain,
      the story of a community becomes a panoramic drama. With
      great dexterity, Armstrong narrates the Sunni-Shi'ite schism,
      the rise of Persian influence, the clashes with Western
      crusaders and Mongolian conquerors, and the spiritual
      explorations that traced the route to God. Armstrong brings
      us through the debacle of European colonialism right up to
      the present day, putting Islamic fundamentalism into context
      as part of a worldwide phenomenon. 
      <em>Islam: A Short History</em> , like Bruce Lawrence's 
      <em>Shattering the Myth</em> and Mark Huband's 
      <em>Warriors of the Prophet</em> , introduces us to a faith
      that beckons like a minaret to those who dare to venture
      beyond the headlines. 
      <em>--Brian Bruya</em>

<h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
      
<p>Readers seeking a quick but thoughtful introduction to
      Islam will want to peruse Armstrong's latest offering. In her
      hallmark stylish and accessible prose, the author of A
      History of God takes readers from the sixth-century days of
      the Prophet Muhammad to the present. Armstrong writes about
      the revelations Muhammad received, and explains that the
      Qur'an earned its name (which means recitation) because most
      of Muhammad's followers were illiterate and learned his
      teachings not from reading them but hearing them proclaimed
      aloud. Throughout the book, Armstrong traces what she sees as
      Islam's emphasis on right living (? la Judaism) over right
      belief (? la Christianity). Armstrong is at her most
      passionate when discussing Islam in the modern world. She
      explains antagonisms between Iraqi Muslims and Syrian
      Muslims, and discusses the devastating consequences of
      modernization on the Islamic world. Unlike Europe, which
      modernized gradually over centuries, the Islamic world had
      modernity thrust upon it in an exploitative manner. The
      Islamic countries, Armstrong argues, have been "reduced to a
      dependent bloc by the European powers." Armstrong also
      rehearses some basics about Islamic fundamentalism in a
      section that will be familiar to anyone who has read her
      recent study, The Battle for God. A useful time line and a
      guide to the "Key Figures in the History of Islam" complete
      this strong, brisk survey of 1,500 years of Islamic history.
