        A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of
      the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz
      Ansari, the star of
        <em>Master of None</em>
         and one of this
      generation’s sharpest comedic voices**
      </p>
      <p>At some point, every one of us embarks on a journey
      to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of
      relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with
      whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard
      now, but it’s wildly different from what people
      did even just decades ago. Single people today have
      more romantic options than at any point in
      human history. With technology, our abilities to
      connect with and sort through these options are
      staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?</p>
      <p>Some of our problems are unique to our
      time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a
      pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even
      though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack
      foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a
      message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan?
      Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I
      check just to be sure?” </p>
      <p>But the transformation of our romantic
      lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a
      short period of time, the whole culture of finding
      love has changed dramatically. A few decades
      ago, people would find a decent person who lived
      in their neighborhood. Their families would
      meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like
      a murderer, they would get married and soon have a
      kid, all by the time they were twenty-four.
      Today, people marry later than ever and spend years
      of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person,
      a soul mate.</p>
      <p>
        For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic
      insight at modern romance, but for
        <em>Modern Romance</em>
        , the book, he decided he needed
      to take things to another level. He teamed up with
      NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a
      massive research project, including hundreds of
      interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere
      from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They
      analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their
      own online research forum on Reddit, which
      drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the
      world’s leading social scientists, including
      Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena
      Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer.
      The result is unlike any social science or humor book
      we’ve seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In
        <em>Modern Romance</em>
        , Ansari combines his irreverent
      humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an
      unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.**

      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong>
        Aziz
      Ansari’s first book
        <em>Modern Love</em>
        is thoughtful, deep, and outright
      hilarious: it’s definitely not your run-of-the-mill
      actor/comedian book offering, and it works. He takes a hot
      topic that has been a part of his recent
      stand-up—navigating this minefield called
      dating—and brings it to a whole new level. The book
      includes extensive research, data, and insight from leading
      experts in the field (he co-wrote it with a social
      scientist)—all sprinkled with Ansari’s signature,
      and spot-on, voice of a generation. Would I have read
        <em>Modern Love</em>
        by [insert name of expert here]? No way.
      If I am going to take a long hard look at this subject, I
      want Ansari along for the ride. Aziz lets you know the
      struggle is real, and we’re all going through it, so be
      nice.

      makes hearts flutter and break across the globe, but most
      importantly, it dissects those ideas through the lens of a
      right-and-left swiping society. And as a result,
      Ansari’s final product doesn’t only feel
      complete—it’s hilariously executed, even without
      his unmistakable high-register voice belting the punchlines.
      At 250 pages, Modern Romance is a lean, pithy read
      that’s perfect to reach the tech-obsessed generation it
      explores.”
